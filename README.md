# EDA and data cleaning

here the EDA was done by cleaning data, like replacing null values with satisfactory values, deleting duplicate rows, changing data-set to relevent data type which were not in relevent form.

### Now finally we tried to extract maximum possible legal questions from given data-set and tried to solve them to extract pattern and hidden analysis behind it, the questions are like,

Q1. Which hotel type is preferred the most?

Q2. which hotel has a higher booking cancellation?

Q3. How long do people prefer to stay in both hotels?

Q4. Which hotel require more car parking spaces?

Q5. Which hotel generates the most revenue?

Q6. Which are the busiest months for hotel?

Q7. Which hotel has the highest lead time?

Q8. Was a hotel likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

Q9. Visualization of monthly bookings and monthly cancellations.

Q10. Relationship between lead time and cancellation.

Q11. Which type of customers book hotels the most?

Q12. Which type of customers make the special requests?

Q13. Which customer type has the highest cancellation of bookings?

Q14. When the best time of year to book a hotel room is?

Q15. Relationship between ADR and the total number of stays.

Q16. Which hotel generates the highest revenue i.e. Average Daily Rate Per Person?

Q17. Which distribution channel is mostly used?

Q18. Which distribution channel generates the most revenue for hotels?

Q19. analyzing which deposit type is preferred most?

Q20. Which type of meal is most and least preferred by the customers?

Q21. Analyzing customer retention on customer type.

Q22. Which room type is in most demand and which room type generates the highest average daily rate?

Q23.Which country has the greatest number of guests?

### Now briefly, concluded as;

1.City Hotels are more popular and generate more revenue compared to Resort Hotels. 

2.Duration of stays and ADR are negatively correlated.

3.The busiest months for hotels are July and August for both types of hotels.

4.Higher lead time leads to higher booking cancellations and vice-versa.

5.The most demanding room type is A (room with a discount available).

6.Room type H (room with complementary health facilities) generates more revenue for hotels as compare to other room types.

7.The popular meal type is BB (Bed and Breakfast).

8.Southern Europe (group countries) is the best contributor.

So, at the end of our analysis we can say things like business partners, customer satisfaction, choices available for the customers, services provided by hotels play a major role in hotelâ€™s establishment and sustainability.

Therefore for a good start the things appeared, finally after this entire analysis, should be taken into consideration.
